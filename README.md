## Branch structure
This repository follows the [gitflow logic](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  

### Branch logic
These are the main branches:
- master &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branch containing stable versions; do not commit to this branch;
Only merge from release branch.
- release &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branch for preparing releases; commits to this branch only contain
version bumps and generated documentation; only merge from dev branch; merge to
master and dev branches
- dev &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branch for main development; all commits allowed; merge from master
and release branches  

Supporting branches [optional]:
- feature_*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branches for developing new features; can be used to keep dev
branch clean and the development build working; only branches from and merges to
the dev branch
- issue_*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branches for solving issues; name mostly referring to issue numbers;
can branch from every other branch except (!) from master; merges only with the
branch from witch it was branched
