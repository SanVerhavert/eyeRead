#' A simulated dataset with eye tracking data
#' 
#' This data set contains simulated eye tracking data for demonstration purposes.  
#' It has the correct data structure for use with the package eyeRead. Mind that 
#' it also contains expected results from functions.  
#' 
#' @format A data set with 37 rows and 8 variables
#' \describe{
#'   \item{fixationIndex}{a unique numerical index for each fixation}
#'   \item{AOI1}{1 if AOI1 was fixated at that time and 0 otherwise}
#'   \item{AOI2}{1 if AOI2 was fixated at that time and 0 otherwise}
#'   \item{AOI3}{1 if AOI3 was fixated at that time and 0 otherwise}
#'   \item{AOI}{the name of the AOI that was fixated at that time; expected outcome of codePasses}
#'   \item{xcoord}{the x coordinate of the fixation position; origin top left}
#'   \item{ycoord}{the y coordinate of the fixation position; origin top left}
#'   \item{fixTime}{the time duration that the AOI was fixated}
#'   \item{passes}{the result of codePasses with \code{rereading = TRUE}}
